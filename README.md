#Wikipedia Data Analysis By Puneet Kumar

This analysis consists of using big data tools to answer questions about datasets from Wikipedia. 
There are a series of analysis questions, answered using Hive and MapReduce. The tools used are determined based on the context for each question. 
The output of the analysis includes MapReduce jarfiles and .hql files so that the analysis is a repeatable process that works on a larger dataset, not just an ad hoc calculation.
